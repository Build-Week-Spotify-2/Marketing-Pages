        <h2>How does it work?</h2> 
        <p>
            Our song recomendations are based off of sound attributes that your known favorite songs share. Things like accousticness; dancibility, energy, instrumentalness, key, loudness, speechiness and more, are all things we use to create a list of recomended songs you might want to add to your own spotify playlists, based off of how much of these musical attributes are associated with your own known likes.

            Tired of listening to every song in a given genre to find something that satisfies? How about listening to music that relate to your favorite tracks on a level higher than being like genred. Start listeningt to music that share the same attributes as the songs you adore, and maybe you'll realize a deeper connection with the music you love.
